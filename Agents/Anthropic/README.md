# How Can You Build a Financial Agentic System Using Anthropic, LlamaIndex, and APIs?

I used Anthropicâ€™s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, LlamaIndex, and the Financial Modeling Prep API to streamline the retrieval of financial data. 
How does it work, and what can it do?

## ðŸ‘‰ The goal
The goal of this agentic system is to allow us to access essential financial data â€” such as stock prices, income statements, and company's informationâ€” and generate deeper insights for decision-making. 
This leverages on the capabilities of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, one of the most capable LLM, on using tools calling functionality.


## ðŸ‘‰The Process:
- Retrieve Financial Data: With this agentic system, we can fetch stock prices, volume, earnings, and even upcoming announcements.

- Access Comprehensive Company Financials: The system provides key company's information like market capitalization, sector classification, and beta values.

- Generate Income Statements: Easily access annual income statements, including revenue, net income, and EBITDA, for thorough analysis.


## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways:
- The system not only retrieves data but also compares it with previous financial performance for more insightful analysis.

- It recalls data from previous queries to fill in missing details.

- Financial data retrieval is faster and more efficient, pulling from multiple endpoints simultaneously.
