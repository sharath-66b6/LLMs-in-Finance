        "# Learn how to build your own Multi-Agent Fundamental Analysis Workflow with LlamaIndex\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agents\n",
        "By leveraging on AgentWorflow class from LlamaIndex, we'll create a multi-agent system composed of:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A fundamental_agent: Responsible for collecting ratios for a given ticker using the FinanceToolkit package\n",
        "\n",
        "- A profitability_agent: Responsible for gathering profitability ratios (ROA, ROE, Net Profit Margin, and Gross Margin) and analyzing their strengths or weaknesses compared to given thresholds. For example, if ROA > 5%, the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A liquidity_agent: This agent collects liquidity ratios for a given ticker (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Interest Coverage Ratio) and comments on these ratios given a set of threshold values. For example if Current Ratio is between 1.5-3.0 the firm is in a healthy range.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A supervisor_agent: This agent provides a final comment on the overall health of the firm based on the different comments coming from the different agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "I've limited my agents to 2 specialized ones, you can add as much as you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Agent's Breakdown:\n",
        "Then for each agent:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A clear description of the goal of the agent was provided\n",
        "\n",
        "- A system prompt of the agent's instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Tool (you can also provide several tools) that helps gathering the data needed and compare it to the set of the pre-defined thresholds.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The next agent to take the handoff.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools\n",
        "There are 4 tools, each agent has a tool. Each tool can act and modify the State of the multi-agent system.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## AgentWorkflow\n",
        "Finally, the AgentWorkflow class puts all these together:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You list the agents to use\n",
        "\n",
        "- You specify the agent root\n",
        "\n",
        "- You initiate your state\n",
        "\n",
        "## LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "I used GPT-4o and compare it to the latest model of OpenAI GPT-4.5-preview.\n",
        "(I've used function calling because these agents supports natively tool calling).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- The workflow is easy to put in place\n",
        "- The agent's breakdown is well-defined, from its description to the system prompt and the next agents for handoff.\n",
        "- I called LLMs inside of the tools to provide insights on the ratios compared to the thresholds. Otherwise, I faced sometimes some hallucination...\n",
        "- The final answer from GPT-4.5-preview is well-structured compared to GPT-4o, providing key ratios, values, comments, and overall insights."

            "- **Score:** 3\n",
