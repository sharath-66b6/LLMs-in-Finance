# üåü LLMs-in-Finance
**Exploring how to apply GenAI to real-world financial workflows with AI Agents, RAG, and Multimodal LLMs**

Welcome to the **LLMs-in-Finance** repository!  
Here, you'll find hands-on **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating how to apply the latest Generative AI tools‚Äîlike **OpenAI's Agents SDK**, **Anthropic's Claude**, **AutoGen**, **LlamaIndex**, and **CrewAI**‚Äîto practical finance use cases.

üöÄ Whether you're building a multi-agent system to analyze markets, applying RAG to earnings reports, or testing multimodal models on financial charts‚Äîthis repo is for you!

If you find this work helpful, **please consider giving the repository a ‚≠êÔ∏è** to support and help others discover it!

## üîç What's Inside?

This repo is structured into the following key areas:

- **[AI Agents in Finance](#ai-agents-in-finance)** ‚Äî Use frameworks like AutoGen, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI to create collaborative agents for financial analysis.
- **[RAG](#rag)** ‚Äî Learn to retrieve, parse, and analyze financial documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques.
- **[Multimodals](#multimodals)** ‚Äî Test how well models like GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 interpret charts in earnings reports.
- **[Papers in Finance](#papers-in-finance)** ‚Äî A curated summary of research papers on GenAI in financial applications.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

*   How Can You Build a Financial Agentic System Using Anthropic, LlamaIndex, and APIs?


## [RAG](https://github.com/hananedupouy/LLMs-in-Finance/tree/main/RAG)

In this part, I provide several examples with various providers/libraries on how to parse complex financial reports: LlamaIndex, Anthropic, OpenAI, aisuite.

Some interesting notebooks to look at:
*   [Financial Report Analysis with LlamaParse AutoMode](RAG/llamaindex/Financial_Report_Analysis_with_LlamaParse_AutoMode.ipynb)
*   [Prompt Caching With Anthropic](https://github.com/hananedupouy/LLMs-in-Finance/blob/main/RAG/Anthropic/Anthropic_Prompt_Caching.ipynb)

I've also inlcluded an example on how to **evaluate** your RAG system with DeepEval, GiskarAI.

## [Multimodals](https://github.com/hananedupouy/LLMs-in-Finance/tree/main/Multimodal_llms/financial_analysis)

You'll find in this repo several examples showcasing the use of various multimodal LLMs such Claude sonnet 3.5, GPT-4o and recently released o1 Reasoning model. The goal is to evaluate how effectively they interpret complex charts found in financial reports.


## [Papers in Finance](https://github.com/hananedupouy/LLMs-in-Finance/tree/main/Papers)

I provide here a brief description of several papers discussing the application of GenAI in finance.
